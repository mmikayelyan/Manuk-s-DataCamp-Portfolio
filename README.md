# Manuk-s-DataCamp-Portfolio
Welcome to my DataCamp portfolio, where I showcase my skills in SQL and Python.  
This repository includes a variety of projects I completed on DataCamp, covering topics such as data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. From building SQL queries to exploring data with Python libraries, these projects demonstrate my proficiency in programming languages and technologies commonly used in data-driven fields.  

I hope you enjoy exploring my portfolio and learning more about my experience in the world of data!
